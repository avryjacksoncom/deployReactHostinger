# deployReactHostinger
  """      - I had an issue with updating my portfolio website automatically.      Hostinger's platform to host domains had an deploy feature or      auto deploy feature that did not work for me becuase I was      using react. It said it needed like console.something, which      was php related.           Key things:      - Summary: It connects your terminal and and with the        hosting terminal dir. via SSH       - Only runs with pw. Will make one with ssh keys.      - Works for updating react projects that have a build folder.      - Don't know if it works with other framewroks, hosting sites        and or tech stacks. Only works for front end react with        Hostinger.           - So this program runs npm install, (if you need it don't have      to do it everytime)runs npm run build, grabs those files, and       uses paramiko (SSH library), connects to the hostinger and uploads       all the files in the Build folder to hosingers dir public HTML.       - You Have to like set env varialbles for your path. For example below.       - If you dont know how to do that ill give a little tutorial on how.        and maybe i can make an add on so you can just make them automatically.       - Can edit out some of the listing commands if you want. I had them       there to see if commands were working code works or not.  """
